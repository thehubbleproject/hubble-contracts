# Kubernetes (k8s) manifests

These are k8s manifests used to confgure and deploy two Hubble testnets
- development, which is used by Hubble developers to observe & test mainline (master) changes
- goerli, which is Hubble's public testnet and contains released contracts and node code

Note that parts of these k8s manifests are specific to [Digital Ocean's k8s](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/), primarily persistent storage.
